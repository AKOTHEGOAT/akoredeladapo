<h2> The Start of Ako.visions </h2>

<p> The start of Ako.vision was a huge personal accomplishment for me. Due to that, I'm reserved with my passion for photography with others. </p>

<p> But on January 25th, 2024, I started my Instagram page dedicated to sharing my visions with the world. Ako. visions allow me to be able to share my vision with the world but, also learning from other people and continue growing as both a photographer and a person </p>
